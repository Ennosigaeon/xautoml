    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credit risk\n",
    "Credit Risk is the probable risk of loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. If a company offers credit to its client,then there is a risk that its clients may not pay their invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Credit Risk\n",
    "Good Risk: An investment that one believes is likely to be profitable. The term most often refers to a loan made to a creditworthy person or company. Good risks are considered exceptionally likely to be repaid.\n",
    "Bad Risk: A loan that is unlikely to be repaid because of bad credit history, insufficient income, or some other reason. A bad risk increases the risk to the lender and the likelihood of default on the part of the borrower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Based on the attributes, classify a person as good or bad credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description:\n",
    "The dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 independent variables (7 numerical, 13 categorical) and 1 target variable prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.The attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "* Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark.\n",
    "* Duration in months\n",
    "* Credit history (credits taken, paid back duly, delays, critical accounts)\n",
    "* Purpose of the credit (car, television,...)\n",
    "* Credit amount\n",
    "* Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark.\n",
    "* Present employment, in number of years.\n",
    "* Installment rate in percentage of disposable income\n",
    "* Personal status (married, single,...) and sex\n",
    "* Other debtors / guarantors\n",
    "* Present residence since X years\n",
    "* Property (e.g. real estate)\n",
    "* Age in years\n",
    "* Other installment plans (banks, stores)\n",
    "* Housing (rent, own,...)\n",
    "* Number of existing credits at this bank\n",
    "* Job\n",
    "* Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for\n",
    "* Telephone (yes,no)\n",
    "* Foreign worker (yes,no)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target\n",
    "* Grant credit `good` or denied credit `bad`"
