    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute Information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "* id: unique identifier\n",
    "* gender: \"Male\", \"Female\" or \"Other\"\n",
    "* age: age of the patient\n",
    "* hypertension: `0` if the patient doesn't have hypertension, `1` if the patient has hypertension\n",
    "* heart_disease: `0` if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, `1` if the patient has a heart disease\n",
    "* ever_married: `No` or `Yes`\n",
    "* work_type: `children`, `Govt_jov`, `Never_worked`, `Private` or `Self-employed`\n",
    "* Residence_type: `Rural` or `Urban`\n",
    "* avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood in mg/dL\n",
    "* bmi: body mass index\n",
    "* smoking_status: `formerly smoked`, `never smoked`, `smokes` or _Unknown_\n",

    "### Target\n",
    "* stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "You want to build a predictive model for pre-screening patients for a high stroke risk. The idea is that for each patient, the according features are automatically analyzed and in case of a high stroke risk, you are informed about the presence of the stroke risk.\n",

    "## Data Set\n",
    "\n",
